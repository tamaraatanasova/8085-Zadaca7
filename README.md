From gated port to address OAh per interrupt
sequence reads a string of an unknown number of characters but no
greater than 128. The beginning of the sequence is indicated by the code AAh, a

data with value AAh. Place on top of the steak
the largest and smallest data of the array. If they are
more than 128 data occur, the ÂµP operation stops.
